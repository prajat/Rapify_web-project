                    <div class="album__description">However individuals and individual outlets felt, Syre was
                        certainly Smith's declaration of intent. It was bold enough to win attention and fans. Two years
                        later, many are ready to see what's next. If the three tracks on ERYS IS COMING are any
                        indication, I think we're in store for a minimalist project that juxtaposes explosive trap with
                        slashes of vulnerability and packing a sly density. I love that "ERYS" is "SYRE" backwards (one
                        of Jaden's middle names). It'll be fun to see if there's continuity between the albums.</div>
